## Setup

### Init a normal repository

In case for a normal repository, which is usually applied in a develope directory. This is a very commonly used with GitHub or custom git server together.

```Git
git init
```

### Init a bare (naked) repository

In case for a shared / team repository. Normally used in a custom git server.

```Git
git init --bare
```

### create a new repository on the command line

```Git
echo "# learngithub" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin <origin>
git push -u origin master
```

### push an existing repository from the command line

```Git
git remote add origin <origin>
git push -u origin master
```

## Configurations

### Config the user name and email

#### In gloabal

```Git
git config --global user.name

git config --global user.email

```

#### In local

```Git
git config --local user.name <user name>

git config --local user.email <user email>
```

### Setting colors

```Git
git config --global core.autocrlf true

git config --global core.autocrlf input

git config --global color.ui auto

```

### Cheking logs

```Git
git log
```

## Commit

### Check status

```Git
git status
```

### Add files into staging area

```git
git add <file>
```

### Commit files

```git
git commit -m "<description>"
```

## Diff

### Diff comparing the current working to the staged 

### Diff comparing the staged area to the last commit

To see what staged changes are made to the last local commit, "**--staged**" means the status after **git add**.

```git
git diff --staged

git diff --cached
```

### Diff comparing current working to the HEAD

To see what current changes in working, no matter staged or unstaged, are made to HEAD, which means the recently last commit

```git
git diff HEAD
```

### Stylish Diff commands

To check the difference in words

```git
git diff --color-words
```

### Diff in status

To return the differences of status

```git
# current working against staged (default)
git diff --stat
# staged against last local commit
git diff --cached --stat
# current working against last local commit
git diff HEAD --stat
```

## Log

### Log in the most easy way

```git 
git log
```

This command shows all logs from the latest to the oldest in timeline.

### Log in one line or / and with stats

```git
# log in one line, only shortend commit ref and message
git log --oneline
# log with stats, all invloved files.
git log --stat
# log in oneline and with stat
git log --oneline --stat
```

### Log with chained parameters

```git
git log --graph --all --decorate --oneline 
```

## Remove

### Remove file from the stage

```git
git rm file1.txt
```

> Note:
> With using the command above, "file1.txt" is only removed from cache/stage. The branch will not be affected, until "**git commit**" is called. By "**git status**", the removed / deleted files will be displayed, before commit.

```git
#remove
git rm file1.txt
#check
git status
#commit
git commit -m "Remove file1.txt"
```

### Remove deleted file

```git
# delete from file system
rm file2.txt
# check status
git status
# even the file is deleted, it can still be removed from stage 
git rm file2.txt
```

### Update all tracked files (most commonly used)

which also means all delted files can be removed, if they have been tracked before. However, the modification in other tracked files will be updated, too.

```git
git add -u
# or starting from the current path and walking 
# through all sub directories recursively
git add -u .
```

### Remove file from cached / stage

```git
git rm --cahced file3.txt
```

> Note: The file was not removed from file system. Instead it is no more tracked by **git**.

## Move

### Move a file to a different path

Suppose we have a tracked file "**header.jpg**" in current path, and we want to move it to "**source/header.jpg**"

```git
git mv header.jpg source/header.jpg
```

### In case moved a file without using `git mv` but `mv`

```git
# move file
mv prod.log production.log
# fix this by 1. deleting the old file and add new file.
git rm prod.log
git add production.log
```

With `git status`, the **renamed** hint will be shown as same as the example above.

### Moving a bunch of files

All changes from current path and sub directories will be staged.

```git
git add -A .
```

### Moving files under a certain directory

```git
git add <path>/
```

> Note: all changes under the path and its sub directories will be staged.

### Display the histories of a file

```git
# it cannot show the history across the move
git log --stat -- source/svg/header.svg
# This one below can show every history with -M
git log --stat -M --follow -- source/svg/header.svg
```

## .gitignore

### init `.gitignore`

```git
touch .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "some description"
```

### `.gitignore` Pattern Format

- A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
- A line starting with `#` serves as a comment. Put a backslash `\`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
- Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash (`\`).
- An optional prefix `!` which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash (`\`) in front of the first `!` for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, `\!important!.txt`.
- The slash `/` is used as the directory separator. Separators may occur at the beginning, middle or end of the `.gitignore` search pattern.
- If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern, then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular `.gitignore` file itself. Otherwise the pattern may also match at any level below the .gitignore level.
- If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only match directories, otherwise the pattern can match both files and directories.
- For example, a pattern `doc/frotz/` matches `doc/frotz` directory, but not `a/doc/frotz` directory; however `frotz/` matches `frotz` and `a/frotz` that is a directory (all paths are relative from the `.gitignore` file).
- An asterisk `*` matches anything except a slash. The character `?` matches any one character except `/`. The range notation, e.g. `[a-zA-Z]`, can be used to match one of the characters in a range. See `fnmatch(3)` and the `FNM_PATHNAME` flag for a more detailed description.
- Two consecutive asterisks (`**`) in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:
- A leading `**` followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, `**/foo` matches file or directory `foo` anywhere, the same as pattern `foo`. `**/foo/bar` matches file or directory `bar` anywhere that is directly under directory `foo`.
- A trailing `/**` matches everything inside. For example, `abc/**` matches all files inside directory `abc`, relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file, **with infinite depth**.
- A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, `a/**/b` matches `a/b`, `a/x/b`, `a/x/y/b` and so on.
- Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will match according to the previous rules.

### list all tracked files in git filtered by .gitignore

```git
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard
```
